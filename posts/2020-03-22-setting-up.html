        <p>getting Hakyll to run on Nix was pretty miserable. The command to start the watch process ends up being like 10 or 12 directories deep. It’s probably because I don’t know about how Nix wants me to handle Haskell stuff yet.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing a lot of Rust. I should probably start having a more set schedule for each day…</p>
<p>Getting Nix installed was pretty easy. I like the structure it gives to Linux. Learning a novel thing sounded pretty good too.</p>
<p>I got an urbit planet from someone I follow on twitter. I’ve been fiddling with it for a little bit, it took a little while for it to work (the install process is extremely janky, and the wiki was outdated.) I’ll start messing with Hoon tomorrow I think, but I don’t have too high hopes for it. I am interested in the interface design parts of urbit though.</p>
<p>Got tags working! I was considering using Hugo but I like Haskell so Hakyll seemed like a good choice. The docs are sparse but it seems pretty powerful. I’m excited to get confused with it.</p>
<p>It’s 1:19 am on saturday, march 22nd. I feel a little sick but not much. I think I’ll go to bed now.</p>
