This is my first post. As I'm basically supposed to not meet with people for a
while, I figured now was as good as ever to start writing posts. I've been
mostly tinkering with Nix, Haskell, and Urbit so you can expect a lot of posts
about those. Sometime I might write down things about myself, too.
