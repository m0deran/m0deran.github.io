getting Hakyll to run on Nix was pretty miserable. The command to start the
watch process ends up being like 10 or 12 directories deep. It's probably
because I don't know about how Nix wants me to handle Haskell stuff yet.

I've been playing a lot of Rust. I should probably start having a more set
schedule for each day...

Getting Nix installed was pretty easy. I like the structure it gives to Linux.
Learning a novel thing sounded pretty good too.

I got an urbit planet from someone I follow on twitter. I've been fiddling with
it for a little bit, it took a little while for it to work (the install process
is extremely janky, and the wiki was outdated.) I'll start messing with Hoon
tomorrow I think, but I don't have too high hopes for it. I am interested in the
interface design parts of urbit though.

Got tags working! I was considering using Hugo but I like Haskell so Hakyll
seemed like a good choice. The docs are sparse but it seems pretty powerful. I'm
excited to get confused with it.

It's 1:19 am on saturday, march 22nd. I feel a little sick but not much. I think
I'll go to bed now.
